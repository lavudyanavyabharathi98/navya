      <h1>1. Taj Mahal </h1>
Agra is an unmissable stop on your tour of India. There are many places of interest to a visitor in Agra, the most famous of course being the iconic and very beautiful Taj Mahal. 
<br>
A UNESCO World Heritage site and an eternal symbol of love (it was built by an emperor in memory of his third wife). The white-domed structure boasts delicately detailed interiors, tranquil gardens and a collection of other impressive buildings.<br> <br>
<p>
  <h1> 2.  Varanasi</h1>
  An intriguing and beautiful city which is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains.<br>
If you wanted to bottle the essence of Hindu spirituality, then Varanasi would be the place to do it. Walking along the ghats along the River Ganges in this Uttar Pradesh city is not an experience that any visitor ever forgets.

While this city is very much alive, it is also fundamentally about death and rebirth. Here you can watch public cremation ceremonies at the Ganges by day and witness the Hindu aarti ritual by night. Aarti is a part of puja (worship) where light is offered to the gods at the different ghats.

Holy men (known as sadhus) as well as babas and aghoris all spend their days down at the ghats. The sadhus are holy men, often swathed in orange, babas are so-called spiritual gurus and aghoris drink the blood of the dead and cover themselves in cremation ashes.   </p>

  <h1> 3. Goa </h1>
  </html>The famously beautiful beach and party resort.
  The famous idyllic party place should not be missed and it’s still one of the most popular places to visit in India as well as the most beautiful. If you decide to take a trip, I recommend not leaving the island’s coastal areas. Goa is the smallest state in India and has the most beautiful beaches by far – when you’re here you’ll want to make the most of them.<br>
 
Many refer to Goa as a tropical paradise and when you’re here enjoying the warm temperatures, clear turquoise water, and palm trees you’ll also probably agree. If you time your visit around the Goa Carnival held every February you’ll be treated to three days and nights of music, lights, dancers, and awesome food.

This is when the legendary King Momo takes over the state and the island becomes party central. Originally celebrated in the 1800s by locals only, now both tourists and locals come here to have a good time.</p>
